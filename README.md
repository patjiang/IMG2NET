Undergraduate study on how to use python image modification to create a DTW mapping of intersections.

The hope is to create a foundation for image recognition software at understanding human transportation pathways.
In this repository, the main goal is to collaborate with the ASU Transportaion AI Laboratory to find novel methods of
image processing and machine learning to create an accurate model for mapping intersections into GMNS or OSM.
